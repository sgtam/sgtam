- 👋 Hi, I’m @sgtam
- 👀 I’m interested in creating an online community-platform where its members will be able to buy drugs from the pharmaceutical companies all together and not individually by each member. In this way, the purchase cost will fall and the purchase price of a drug will become bearable for everyone. For example, if 1000 members need insulin and they  buy it together, then the cost of transport to the pharmacy and from the pharmacy to the patient is avoided, while discounts from the manufacturers are also possible. At the same time, because sometimes we buy medicines we don't use  at all and simply throw them away after years, I thought that the members of the community could exchange unused medicines with each other in order to drastically reduce the energy footprint of the pharmaceutical industry and make these products accessible for all.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pharmaceutical companies and experienced coders
